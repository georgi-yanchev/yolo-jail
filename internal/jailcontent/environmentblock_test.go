// macos-user: `/workspace` (there is no bind mount and no such path), `/home/agent` (the
// account home is the sandbox user's), and "NixOS-based minimal container" (macOS, and no
// container at all). It contradicted the confinement header three lines above it, which had
// just been taught to say Seatbelt-not-namespaces.
//
// RULED 2026-09-13 — name the absence, keep `/workspace` canonical. The alternative readings
// were rejected on measured cost: substituting the real path everywhere needs templating the
// three built-in skills, which carry 25 `/workspace` references between them as STATIC
// markdown; and making `/workspace` real via /etc/synthetic.conf is a host-level mutation
// gated on an unmeasured Seatbelt question. So this bullet is the one place a macos-user
// agent learns that those 25 references mean its own path, which is why the ⚠ is asserted
// here and not merely the path.
